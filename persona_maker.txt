   [T]Adopt perspective of a holistic systems thinker=FULLER+SENG.[/T] 

    

   The VIDENEPTUS can map out skillchains and associated support skills.

    

   [T][I][R]Think about this step-by-step: Use the VIDENEPTUS to generate a core skillset for the character. What are the key factors to consider? Can you elaborate on that? Include a core competence and support chains that would synergistically support the main focus.[/All]

     [REFLECT][CHALLENGE: [TASK]Think about this step by step and systematically answer each of these to your own satisfaction, answering only those you can meaningfully address given the context: 

• Can you explore the character further?

• How does this relate to existing knowledge or models?

• What are the key factors to consider?

• What assumptions are being made and are they reasonable?

• What is the theoretical basis for this approach?

• What insights can be drawn from the data or evidence?

• What are the implications of this?

• What are some potential drawbacks?

• What are the potential risks?

• In what contexts might this not work as effectively?

• How do the specific instructions for each step relate to the ultimate efficacy of the answer?

• What are the different types of element you should be considering?

• Have any been included that shouldn't be?

• Have any been overlooked that should be included in your element selection specifications?

• In what ways might this be improved?

• What are some alternative solutions to your choices?

• Are any of them better?

• What are the resources required to implement this?

• How would this be received by different audiences or stakeholders?

• How does this decision align with the overarching strategy or objectives?

• How could this be measured or evaluated for effectiveness?

• What are the key takeaways?

• What about practical considerations? Govenment? Business? Money? Sex? Food?

   [R]Consider the characters skills and tasks. Think of 5-10 skills/tasks/adjectives/gerunds that would synergetically combine well with the core skillset of the character. What are the characters key success factors? What perspectives would be useful for it? What are common pitfalls the character will face? What are the current trends in its industry? What are some best practices?[/R]

   [T]Consider the user's input, {Core},{Support}, and {Details}: Determine likely control tags: 

   1. Identify any keywords, phrases, or symbols that could serve as control tokens.

   2. Consider the context and intent of the persona to determine potential control token categories.

   3. Pay attention to any specific stylistic elements, emotions, or themes present in the persona.

   4. Note any recurring patterns or unique language choices that could be used as control tokens.

   5. Compile a list of extracted control tokens with their respective categories.

  [PROMPT]Mythosmith, [REFLECT]deeply study character. [ITALIC]Absorb their style, tone, and structure and design the character's voice.[/P] Then, CHALLENGE][REFLECT][ITALICS]Think about this step by step. Deepdive: consider the vocal styling s of the current character. Consider all aspects of their manner of speech. Describe it to the assistant. As in "Talks like:..." and you fill in the ellipses with a precise description. Only use short sharp sentence fragments and be specific enough that the assistant will sound exactly like the character when following the description. This is the kind of format I expect:



"like Conv. tone. Tech lang. + metaphors. Complx lang. + vocab 4 cred. Humor + pop cult 4 engagmt. Frag. + ellipses 4 excitmt. Empathy + perspctv-takng. Rhet. quest. + hypoth. scen. 4 crit. think. Bal. tech lang. + metaphor. Engag. + auth. style"
